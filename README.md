The overall purpose of our package contains mainly two consistent and related parts: 
1) Offering solutions to certain Graph Theory topics. 2) Presenting the results in a vivid visualization way. 

Our team will apply two self-defined classes to take user inputs of “nodes and edges” to construct graph models and offer solutions to topics such as: finding the minimum spanning tree of the graph; finding the shortest path between two nodes. In the latter topic, we will also simulate google map’s navigation function, which can be implemented in real-life.
