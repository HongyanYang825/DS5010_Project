## Introduction


```python
Our package takes in two parameters: a list of edges and a list of corresponding edge lengths. 
It can be used in daily application of graph theory topics such as finding the shortest path in a road or a network, 
checking if a network is connected or not and how reliable a local network is by checking how many cycles it contains.
